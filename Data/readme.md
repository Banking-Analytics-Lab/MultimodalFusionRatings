## Data Access and Reproducibility

Due to the proprietary nature of the data sources from Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS), direct access to the raw datasets used in our study is restricted. We acknowledge the importance of transparency and reproducibility in research, and as such, have taken several steps to enable others to validate and build upon our work:

### Documentation

- **Comprehensive Data Documentation:** We have prepared a detailed document that provides an exhaustive description of each data source utilized in our study. This document includes:
  - **Data Source and Collection:** Detailed profiles of each dataset, including the types of data contained, the data provider, and the data structure.  Also it outlines how data was collected, processed, and analyzed, ensuring that researchers can understand and replicate our methodology.
  - **Dataset Features and Characteristics:** Detailed explanations of the features and characteristics of each dataset, including any preprocessing or transformations applied.

This documentation is designed to provide researchers with sufficient information to understand the context and constraints of our data without accessing the actual datasets.

### Synthetic Dataset

- **Synthetic Data Generation:** To further support the reproducibility of our analyses, we have created a synthetic dataset. This synthetic dataset is constructed to:
  - **Reflect the Original Data's Structure:** Ensuring that the synthetic data maintains the same format and type distributions as the original data.

- **Purpose and Usage:** The synthetic dataset is provided to enable external parties to run and validate our analytical code. This dataset allows users to:
  - **Test and Execute Analytical Code:** Users can run our provided code against the synthetic dataset to observe how it performs and to modify or extend the analysis.
  - **Validate Methodologies:** By providing a dataset with known properties and outcomes, researchers can validate the efficacy and accuracy of our methods.
