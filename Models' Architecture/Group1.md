## Introduction

Here is an explanation of the fusion strategy used:

- **GROUP 1- Simple Concatenation**:
  - In this group, each numerical dataset separately passed through a network.
  - We then concatenated their penultimate layers, and the simple intermediate level of fusion was used.
  - Following are the architectures of each base model:
