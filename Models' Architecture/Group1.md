*GROUP 1- Simple Concatenation*:
 
  - In this group, each numerical dataset separately passed through a network.  We then concatenated their penultimate layers, and the simple intermediate level of fusion was used.
  - Following are the architectures of each base model:

### CNN based Model: [View architecture](11.pdf)

### LSTM based Model: [View architecture](12.pdf)

### GRU based Model: [View architecture](13.pdf)

### Bert based Model: [View architecture](14.pdf)
